  <p>  <div style="font-size:0.85em; text-align: justify;"> Detecting small-size objects is a primary challenge at archaeological sites due to the high degree of heterogeneity present in the near surface. Although high-resolution reflection seismic imaging often delivers the target resolution of the subsurface in different near-surface settings, the standard processing for obtaining an image of the subsurface is not suitable to map local diffractors. This happens because shallow seismic-reflection data are often dominated by strong surface waves which might cover weaker diffractions, and because traditional common-midpoint moveout corrections are only optimal for reflection events. Here, we propose an approach for imaging subsurface objects using masked diffractions. These masked diffractions are firstly revealed by a combination of seismic interferometry and nonstationary adaptive subtraction, and then further enhanced through crosscoherence-based super-virtual interferometry. A diffraction image is then computed by a spatial summation of the revealed diffractions. We use phase-weighted stack to enhance the coherent summation of weak diffraction signals. Using synthetic data, we show that our scheme is robust in locating diffractors from data dominated by strong Love waves. We test our method on field data acquired at an archaeological site. The resulting distribution of shallow diffractors agrees with the location of anomalous objects identified in the $V_S$ model obtained by elastic SH/Love full-waveform inversion using the same field data. The anomalous objects correspond to the position of a suspected burial, also detected in an independent magnetic survey and corings.</div> </p>

	<p>  <div style="font-size:0.85em; text-align: justify;"> We propose a diffraction-imaging method based on optimal summation of seismic diffractions from these objects. An amplitude-unbiased coherency method is used to suppress the incoherent summation
of noise, with the aim to enhance the weak and coherent diffracted signals. The stacking procedure results in a section where diffractions are emphasized and the remaining surface
waves are further suppressed. This diffraction section can be useful for a reliable identification of the local heterogeneities. We demonstrate the reliability of the proposed diffraction imaging method using synthetic and field data.</div> </p>

	<p>  <div style="font-size:0.85em; text-align: justify;"> High-resolution reflection seismics is a powerful tool that can provide the required resolution for subsurface imaging and monitoring in urban settings. Shallow seismic reflection data acquired in soil-covered sites are often contaminated by source-coherent surface waves and other linear moveout noises (LMON) that might be caused by, e.g., anthropogenic sources or harmonic distortion in vibroseis data. In the case of shear-wave seismic reflection data, such noises are particularly
problematic as they overlap the useful shallow reflections. We have developed new schemes for suppressing such surface-wave noise and LMON while still preserving shallow reflections, which are of great interest to high-resolution near-surface imaging. We do this by making use of two techniques. First, we make use of seismic interferometry to retrieve predominantly source-coherent surface waves and LMON. We then adaptively subtract these dominant source-coherent surface waves and LMON from the seismic data in a separate step. We illustrate our proposed method using synthetic and field data. We compare results from our method with results from frequency–wavenumber (f-k) filtering. Using synthetic data, we show that our schemes are robust in separating shallow reflections from source-coherent surface waves and LMON even when they share very similar velocity and frequency contents, whereas f-k filtering might cause undesirable artefacts. Using a field shear-wave reflection dataset characterised by overwhelming LMON, we show that the reflectors at a very shallow depth can be imaged because of significant suppression of the LMON due to the application of the scheme that we have developed. </div> </p>

_[Ghose R.][Ranajit], [Liu J.][Jianhuan], [Draganov D.][Deyan], [Ngan-Tillard D.][Dominique], Warnaar M., [Brackenhoff J.][Joeri] et al., (2020)_, **Leiden University Press**.

	<div id="book01" style="display:none;">
  <p>  <div style="font-size:0.85em; text-align: justify;">The southern boundary of Region IV of ancient Ostia coincides with the southern limit of the excavated area of the ancient city. The perceived expanse of the city is influenced by the extent of the excavation. It is not known whether the unexcavated part lying south of Region IV also contains structures of antiquity which might have important historical significance. We have carried out high-resolution, shallow seismic reflection surveys along two profiles, using shear (transverse) waves. The goal of these pilot surveys was to see whether any indication of ultra-shallow scatterers, indicating the potential location of shallow-buried structures, can be found in the shear- wave data. The results show very distinct back- scattered shear-wave arrivals from a mysterious tumulus, whose location along Line A was known. It has been possible to interpret with reasonable confidence the location of several conspicuous, shallow scatterers in the two seismic profiles. Use of shear waves and a high-frequency, electromagnetic shear-wave vibrator was crucial to achieving seismic resolution of nearly 25 cm. The amplitude of the scattered energy is helpful to locate the relatively strong scatterers. Our results suggest that the unexcavated areas located south of Region IV most likely contain buried underground structures. 3-D shear-wave seismic reflections together with new seismic-imaging approaches will be promising to illuminate the unknown shallow subsurface of this important archaeological site in a non-invasive manner.</div> </p>

	<div id="book02" style="display:none;">
  <p>  <div style="font-size:0.85em; text-align: justify;">A GPR survey was conducted in the frigidarium of the Byzantine baths in 2017 almost 50 years after the area had been excavated, backfilled and re-tiled using a black and white mosaic. GPR signals are interpreted using photographs of the excavation provided by courtesy of Archivio di disegno as well as drawings and texts produced by scholars to retrace the multiple functions that the site had until the Late Antiquity. It is shown that some ancient reticulated wall structures can be recognised in the GPR data, but not all! There are also prominent GPR features which cannot be identified. We conclude that the partial excavation of the site and the backfilling operation have further complicated the structure of the ground below the mosaic of the Byzantine baths.</div> </p>

_[Liu J.][Jianhuan], [Ghose R.][Ranajit] and [Draganov D.][Deyan] (2018)_, 88th Annual International Meeting, **SEG, California, USA**.

	<div id="abstract02" style="display:none;">
  <p>  <div style="font-size:0.85em; text-align: justify;"> High-resolution reflection seismics can be very helpful in subsurface imaging and monitoring in urban environments and in archaeological sites. An obstacle that hinders the success of high-resolution reflection seismic imaging of the very shallow targets is the presence of source-generated surface waves at soil-covered sites and surface waves generated by other anthrogenic sources, e.g., traffic and construction activities in the vicinity of the seismic line. Both of these can hide the very shallow reflection events. We have developed new schemes involving seismic interferometry (SI) to retrieve both source-coherent (and/or source-incoherent) surface waves part of data. The retrieved surface waves are then adaptively subtracted from the raw data, thereby exposing hidden reflections. We illustrate results on both synthetic and field seismic data. We show that artefacts caused by stacking the surface-wave noise are greatly reduced, and that reflectors, especially at very shallow depth, can be much better imaged and interpreted. </div> </p>

_[Liu J.][Jianhuan], [Ghose R.][Ranajit] and [Draganov D.][Deyan] (2017)_, 23th Europen Meeting of Environmental and Engineering Geophysics, **EAGE, Malmö, Sweden**.

	<div id="abstract01" style="display:none;">
	<p>  <div style="font-size:0.85em; text-align: justify;"> It is challenging to image the very shallow structures in a heterogeneous dyke using traditional geophysical methods. With the aim to reveal these structures, a low-budget seismic S-wave reflection survey was carried out
over a dyke with a fixed-receivers array. We applied seismic interferometry to this dataset in order to retrieve surface waves and then adaptively subtracted these surface waves from the original recordings. Combined interpretation of the stacked images obtained from the original data and that from the data after adaptive subtraction reveals more complete shallow structures inside the dyke.</div> </p>
